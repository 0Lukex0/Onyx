## Commands

### Make Electronic Music
You can make your own electronic music just by typing commands, and connecting to a Voice Channel.
Onyx comes with a series of built-in, royalty-free samples, which you can play through a Voice Channel. You can then mix samples together to create songs, and have everyone listen to them.

Firstly, go through some of the samples available by typing `music_cmds`.
Before playing any samples, make sure you're connected to a Voice Channel beforehand, because Onyx will join your Voice Channel then.

Each of the links to the samples are provided when you play each one, so you can go and download the samples at LooperMan.com.

## Features On The Way
I am applying for API keys for the following APIs, so that's why their development is slightly delayed.
- YouTube integration, where users can search for videos, and the first one is sent to the channel.
- Wolfram|Alpha communication, where Onyx can answer virtually any question, thanks to Wolfram Alpha's decades long research and innovation.
- Movie DB search and retrieval for movies and their ratings, actors, etc.,
- Spotify: Provides meta data on various songs.
- Google Knowledge Graph integration
- Oxford Dictionaries definitions and synonyms.
- Unsplash Integration: Allow users to search for any images in the public domain.
- Basic moderation commands, including kicking users, detecting spam, etc.,


    "xkcd_examples" : "xkcd today \n xkcd",
