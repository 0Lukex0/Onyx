## Features On The Way
I am applying for API keys for the following APIs, so that's why their development is slightly delayed.
- YouTube integration, where users can search for videos, and the first one is sent to the channel.
- Wolfram|Alpha communication, where Onyx can answer virtually any question, thanks to Wolfram Alpha's decades long research and innovation.
- Movie DB search and retrieval for movies and their ratings, actors, etc.,
- Spotify: Provides meta data on various songs.
- Google Knowledge Graph integration
- Oxford Dictionaries definitions and synonyms.
- Unsplash Integration: Allow users to search for any images in the public domain.
- Basic moderation commands, including kicking users, detecting spam, etc.,
